          <dd>Music is sound that has been organized by using rhythm, melody or harmony. 
              If someone bangs saucepans while cooking, it makes noise.If a person bangs 
              saucepans or pots in a rhythmic way, they are making a simple type of music.In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form or cultural activity include the creation of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music in two parts: melodies, as tones ordered horizontally, and harmonies as tones ordered vertically.

          <dt class="title-text">Travelling </dt>
          <dd>“The world is a book, and those who do not travel read only a page.” – said 
              Saint Augustine. Travelling can teach you more than any university course. 
              You learn about the culture of the country you visit. If you talk to locals, 
               you will likely learn about their thinking, habits, traditions and history as well.If you travel, you will not only learn about foreign cultures, but about your own as well. You will notice the cultural differences, and will find out what makes your culture unique. After retrurning from a long journey, you will see your country with new eyes.

          <dd>
              Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for an organism. Food is usually of plant, 
              animal or fungal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, 
              or minerals. Most food has its origin in plants. Some food is obtained directly from plants; but even animals that are used as food sources are raised by feeding them food derived from plants. Cereal grain is a staple food that provides more food energy worldwide than any other type of crop.Corn (maize), wheat, and rice – in all of their varieties – account for 87% of all grain production worldwide. Most of the grain that is produced worldwide is fed to livestock.
